# Retainer Alerts

This plugin is meant to give you a simple popup when your retainers are done with their ventures.
The only setting is to move where the popup is located.
On startup you will see a button that says 'click me' simply click it twice to open and close your timers menu.
Any other action that will load your retainers data will also work for closing that button.
